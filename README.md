# multiauth_tweepy

An extension of tweepy..
This piece of code takes a list of user_ids as input and returns userobjects or user timelines(upto 3200 tweets) using as many authorization keys as you provide.
This tries to parallelize the process maximally for fastest data collection.
Faster data collection is important for social scientists and other researchers. Hope this helps a bit.
